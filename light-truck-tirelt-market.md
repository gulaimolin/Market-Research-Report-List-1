<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light Truck Tire(LT) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The light truck tire (LT) market consists of two main types: bias tires and radial tires. Bias tires have a structure where the tire plies overlap at an angle, providing a stiff sidewall for increased load capacity and stability. They tend to be more affordable but have less traction and shorter tread life compared to radial tires. Radial tires, on the other hand, have cords that run perpendicular to the tire's circumference, resulting in a more flexible sidewall and better grip. They are preferred for their improved fuel efficiency, comfort, and longer lifespan.</p></p>
