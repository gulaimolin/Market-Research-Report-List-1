<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuroendoscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Neuroendoscope</li><li>Flexible Neuroendoscope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neuroendoscopes are medical devices used to diagnose and treat neurological conditions. Rigid neuroendoscopes have a fixed structure and offer greater stability during procedures, allowing for precise examination of brain and spinal structures. Flexible neuroendoscopes, on the other hand, are more versatile and can navigate through narrow and curved pathways, providing access to hard-to-reach areas. Both market segments cater to different requirements and preferences of healthcare professionals, ensuring effective neurosurgical interventions.</p></p>

<p><ul><li>Transnasal</li><li>Intraventricular</li><li>Transcranial</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neuroendoscopes are medical instruments used for minimally invasive procedures in the field of neurosurgery. Transnasal neuroendoscopes are inserted through the nostrils to access and treat lesions in the brain or pituitary gland. Intraventricular neuroendoscopes are guided through small holes drilled in the skull to examine and treat conditions within the ventricles or fluid-filled spaces of the brain. Transcranial neuroendoscopes are inserted through small holes in the skull to access deep areas of the brain for diagnosis and treatment. Each of these neuroendoscope applications offers a less invasive approach, reducing patient trauma and recovery time.</p></p>
