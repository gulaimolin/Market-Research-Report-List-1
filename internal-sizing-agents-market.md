<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Internal Sizing Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ASA</li><li>AKD</li><li>Rosin</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Internal sizing agents are chemicals used in the paper industry to enhance the water resistance and improve printability of paper. ASA (alkenyl succinic anhydride) is a commonly used internal sizing agent that reacts with cellulose fibers to create a hydrophobic surface layer. AKD (alkyl ketene dimer) works in a similar way and is particularly effective in resisting yellowing. Rosin, derived from pine trees, is another internal sizing agent used to make paper more resistant to water. Other types of internal sizing agents may include synthetic chemicals that provide specific properties to the paper, such as improved ink adhesion or reduced ink bleed.</p></p>
