<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antifreeze Testers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Float</li><li>Disc</li><li>Needle</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Antifreeze testers are used to measure the freezing temperature of engine coolant. There are three main types of antifreeze testers: Float, Disc, and Needle. </p><p>Float testers work by placing a float of varying density in the coolant solution, and the reading indicates the freezing point. Disc testers consist of a disc with markings representing temperatures, and when it sinks to the lowest point in the solution, the freezing point is determined. Needle testers have a needle that is plunged into the coolant, and the reading is taken where it stops. These testers provide precision and convenience for monitoring engine coolant freezing points.</p></p>
