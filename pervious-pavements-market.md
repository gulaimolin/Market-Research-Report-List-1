<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pervious Pavements Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Liquid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pervious pavements refer to pavement materials that allow water to pass through them, promoting natural drainage and reducing stormwater runoff. The pervious pavements market can be categorized into two types: powder and liquid. Powder pervious pavements consist of loose aggregates and powder materials that are mixed on-site to create a porous surface. Liquid pervious pavements, on the other hand, involve the application of liquid binders on existing pavement surfaces to create a porous layer. Both types offer sustainable solutions for managing stormwater in urban environments, albeit employing different methods.</p></p>
