<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Power Distribution Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Primary Power Distribution Unit</li><li>Secondary Power Distribution Unit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft Power Distribution Units (PDUs) are responsible for distributing power from the main power sources to various subsystems in an aircraft. The Primary Power Distribution Unit (PPDU) receives power from the aircraft's main power sources, such as engines or APU, and distributes it to critical systems like flight controls, avionics, and lighting. On the other hand, the Secondary Power Distribution Unit (SPDU) receives power from the PPDU and distributes it to non-critical systems, including cabin lighting, passenger entertainment, and other comfort-related functions. Both PDUs play crucial roles in ensuring proper power distribution for efficient aircraft operation.</p></p>
