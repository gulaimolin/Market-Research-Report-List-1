<p><h1>Global Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Vaccine Market by Types, Applications, and Major Players, with Regional Growth Rate Analysis and Development Situation, from 2023 to 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that belongs to the herpes group of viruses. It can cause infections in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as newborns, transplant recipients, and people living with HIV/AIDS. In pregnant women, CMV can be transmitted to the fetus and cause birth defects.</p><p>A CMV vaccine aims to prevent CMV infection and its associated complications. Currently, there is no licensed CMV vaccine available, but several vaccine candidates are undergoing clinical trials. These include adjuvanted glycoprotein B vaccines, DNA-based vaccines, and vector-based vaccines.</p><p>The future outlook of the CMV vaccine market appears promising due to the increasing awareness about the potential risks of CMV infection, especially in pregnant women. The demand for a preventive vaccine to tackle congenital CMV infections is growing, considering the long-term health implications for infants.</p><p>The current outlook of the CMV vaccine market indicates steady growth. Factors such as increasing healthcare expenditure, advancements in vaccine technology, and rising research and development activities contribute to this growth. Additionally, the support from regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in encouraging CMV vaccine developments further fuels the market's expansion.</p><p>According to a report, the CMV vaccine market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4% during the forecasted period. This growth can be attributed to the anticipated commercialization of CMV vaccines in the coming years and the potential inclusion of the CMV vaccine in routine immunization programs.</p><p>In conclusion, the CMV vaccine market has a promising future due to the increasing demand for preventive measures against CMV infections. The market is expected to witness a steady growth rate, driven by factors such as healthcare expenditure, technological advancements, and regulatory support. However, the development and approval of a licensed CMV vaccine are essential to realize the full potential of the market.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Attenuated Vaccines</li><li>Subunit Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine market includes two main types of vaccines: attenuated vaccines and subunit vaccines. Attenuated vaccines use weakened forms of CMV to trigger an immune response without causing the disease. Subunit vaccines, on the other hand, contain only specific components or antigens of CMV, which prompt the body to develop an immune response. Attenuated vaccines have the potential for more robust immunity but carry a small risk of causing mild disease, while subunit vaccines are safer but may necessitate additional doses to maintain protection.</p></p>
