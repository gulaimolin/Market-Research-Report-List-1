<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Radiator Cap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vented Cap</li><li>Non-Vented Cap</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive radiator cap market consists of two main types: vented cap and non-vented cap. Vented caps allow the excess pressure to escape from the radiator, maintaining a consistent pressure level and preventing any damage to the system. Non-vented caps, on the other hand, do not have this pressure release mechanism and are primarily used in older vehicles or specific applications where pressure management is not a concern. Both types serve the purpose of sealing the radiator and maintaining the optimal cooling system performance in vehicles.</p></p>
