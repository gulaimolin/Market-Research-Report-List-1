<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Steel Bar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Hot-dip Galvanized Rebar</li><li>Continuous Hot-dip Galvanized Rebar</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The galvanized steel bar market includes two main types: conventional hot-dip galvanized rebar and continuous hot-dip galvanized rebar. Conventional hot-dip galvanized rebar is a process where the steel bars are dipped into a bath of molten zinc, providing a protective coating against corrosion. Continuous hot-dip galvanized rebar, on the other hand, involves a continuous process where the steel bars pass through a series of zinc coating baths. Both types of galvanized steel bar offer enhanced corrosion resistance, making them suitable for construction projects in corrosive environments.</p></p>
