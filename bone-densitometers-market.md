<p><strong>The Bone Densitometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)</li><li>Ultrasound</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bone densitometers are medical devices used to measure bone density and diagnose osteoporosis. There are two main types of bone densitometers: DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) and ultrasound. DEXA uses low-energy X-rays to scan the body and measure the amount of radiation that is absorbed by the bones, providing accurate and detailed results. Ultrasound bone densitometers use high-frequency sound waves to measure bone density, providing a portable and less expensive option. Both types of devices play a crucial role in determining bone health and preventing fractures.</p></p>
