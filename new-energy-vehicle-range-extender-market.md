<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The New Energy Vehicle Range Extender Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Cooled Range Extender</li><li>Air Cooled Range Extender</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Range Extender market includes two main types: water-cooled range extenders and air-cooled range extenders. The water-cooled range extenders use a cooling system that circulates water to control the temperature of the engine components. This type ensures efficient cooling, resulting in enhanced performance and durability. On the other hand, air-cooled range extenders rely on air flow to dissipate heat generated by the engine. While they are less complex and cheaper to manufacture, they might have limited cooling capabilities.</p></p>
