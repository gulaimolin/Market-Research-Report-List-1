<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Run-flat Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-supporting Technology</li><li>Self-sealing Technology</li><li>Auxiliary-supported Technology</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automotive Run-flat Tires market can be categorized into three types: </p><p>1. Self-supporting Technology: These run-flat tires are constructed with reinforced sidewalls that can support the weight of the vehicle even when the tire is deflated. This allows the driver to continue driving for a limited distance at a reduced speed, providing time to reach a service station or a safe location.</p><p>2. Self-sealing Technology: These tires are designed with a special lining that can seal punctures quickly after they occur. The self-sealing technology helps maintain tire pressure and prevents immediate air loss, allowing the driver to continue driving without the need to replace the tire immediately.</p><p>3. Auxiliary-supported Technology: These run-flat tires rely on an additional support system, such as an insert or ring, to provide a temporary load-carrying capacity when the tire loses air pressure. The auxiliary support system ensures vehicle stability and enables the driver to continue driving safely until a tire repair or replacement can be made.</p></p>
