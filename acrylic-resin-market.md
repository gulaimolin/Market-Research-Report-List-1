<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylic Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting Acrylic Resin</li><li>Thermoplastic Acrylic Resin</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Acrylic resin market comprises two main types: thermosetting acrylic resin and thermoplastic acrylic resin. Thermosetting acrylic resin is a type of resin that undergoes a chemical reaction during curing and becomes irreversibly hardened. It offers excellent resistance to heat, chemicals, and weathering, making it suitable for various applications such as automotive coatings and electrical insulation. On the other hand, thermoplastic acrylic resin can be melted and re-molded multiple times without undergoing any significant chemical change. It is commonly used in automotive parts, consumer goods, and packaging materials due to its flexibility and ease of processing.</p></p>
