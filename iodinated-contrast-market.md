<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Iodinated Contrast Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>X-ray/Computed Tomography (CT)</li><li>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</li><li>Ultrasound</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Iodinated Contrast is a type of contrast agent used in medical imaging procedures. It is primarily used in X-ray/Computed Tomography (CT) scans to enhance the visibility of blood vessels and organs. In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), gadolinium-based contrast agents are used instead. Ultrasound imaging, on the other hand, does not typically require contrast agents as it uses sound waves to produce images. These contrast agents help to improve the accuracy and clarity of diagnostic images, aiding healthcare professionals in identifying and diagnosing various medical conditions.</p></p>
