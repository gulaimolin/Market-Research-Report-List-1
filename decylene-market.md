<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Decylene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oligomerization Method</li><li>Cracking Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The decylene market consists of two main types: oligomerization method and cracking method. The oligomerization method involves combining smaller molecules to form decylene through a series of chemical reactions. This method allows for the production of high-quality decylene with specific molecular weights. On the other hand, the cracking method involves breaking down larger molecules to obtain decylene. This method is more cost-effective and suitable for large-scale production. Both methods contribute to the overall decylene market by providing different options for its production based on different needs and resources.</p></p>
