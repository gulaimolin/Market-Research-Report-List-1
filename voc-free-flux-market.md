<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Free Flux Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Based</li><li>Alcohol-Based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>VOC (volatile organic compound) free flux is a type of flux used in soldering processes that does not release harmful gases during application. Water-based fluxes are formulations where water is the primary carrier fluid, providing a safer and environmentally friendly option. They are easy to clean and offer good wetting properties. On the other hand, alcohol-based fluxes use alcohol as the primary carrier fluid. They are commonly used in applications where faster evaporation is required and provide excellent solderability. Both types of fluxes are designed to minimize health risks and comply with environmental regulations.</p></p>
