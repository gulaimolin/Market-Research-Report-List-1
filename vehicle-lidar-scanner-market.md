<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle LiDAR Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Lidar</li><li>Solid State Lidar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle LiDAR scanner market can be categorized into two types: mechanical LiDAR and solid-state LiDAR. Mechanical LiDAR systems use moving parts to scan the environment, such as spinning mirrors or rotating lasers. These systems are effective in generating precise 3D images but can be expensive and bulky. On the other hand, solid-state LiDAR systems use stationary components like microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) or optical phased arrays to project and receive laser beams. Solid-state LiDARs are compact, cost-effective, and suitable for mass production, making them increasingly popular in the market.</p></p>
