<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Foaming Agents for Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endothermic Foaming Agent</li><li>Compound Foaming Agent</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Chemical foaming agents are additives used in the plastics industry to produce foamed plastics, which have numerous applications. There are two major types: endothermic foaming agents and compound foaming agents. Endothermic foaming agents decompose when heated, releasing gas and absorbing heat from the surroundings, leading to foam expansion. Compound foaming agents consist of a combination of endothermic and exothermic agents. While endothermic agents provide gas, exothermic agents release heat, promoting cell formation and better foam expansion. Both types contribute to the creation of lightweight and cost-effective foamed plastic products.</p></p>
