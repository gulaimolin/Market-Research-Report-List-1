<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Off-highway Electric Vehicle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Battery Electric Vehicle</li><li>Hybrid Electric Vehicle</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Off-highway electric vehicles are categorized into two types, namely Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). The BEV market refers to vehicles that solely rely on electric power stored in their batteries for propulsion and do not have an internal combustion engine. HEVs, on the other hand, combine an electric motor with an internal combustion engine, allowing them to be powered by both electricity and fuel. These vehicles offer lower emissions, reduced fuel consumption, and enhanced energy efficiency compared to traditional off-highway vehicles.</p></p>
