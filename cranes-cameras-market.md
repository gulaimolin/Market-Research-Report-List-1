<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranes Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infrared</li><li>Non-infrared</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the cranes camera market, there are two main types: infrared and non-infrared cameras. Infrared cameras use infrared radiation to capture images, allowing them to see objects based on their heat signatures. These cameras are especially useful for night vision or applications where detecting heat sources is required. On the other hand, non-infrared cameras capture images using visible light and do not rely on heat detection. These cameras are commonly used in daylight conditions and for general surveillance purposes. Both types of cameras serve different purposes based on their ability to detect heat or visible light.</p></p>
