<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Swing Adsorption(PSA) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Stage PSA</li><li>Rapid PSA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) is a gas separation technology used to purify and separate gases, typically used for air separation or gas purification processes. Double Stage PSA is a two-step process where the gas is first passed through a high-pressure adsorber, and then through a low-pressure adsorber, allowing for a higher purity of gas. Rapid PSA is a faster version of PSA that uses smaller adsorbers and shorter cycle times, resulting in quicker gas separation. Both double stage PSA and Rapid PSA technologies offer increased efficiency and faster gas purification processes.</p></p>
