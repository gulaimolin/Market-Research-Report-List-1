<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Fixation and Stabilization System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonresorbable</li><li>Resorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cranial fixation and stabilization system market can be divided into two types: nonresorbable and resorbable. Nonresorbable systems are made of materials that do not degrade over time and provide permanent fixation of the cranial bones. Resorbable systems, on the other hand, are made of materials that gradually degrade and are absorbed by the body over time. This allows for natural healing without the need for subsequent removal of the hardware. Both types of systems are used in neurosurgical procedures to stabilize and support the cranium.</p></p>
