<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HIV Screening Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rapid Immunoassay Test</li><li>Rapid Molecular Diagnostic Test</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>HIV screening machines comprise two main types: rapid immunoassay tests and rapid molecular diagnostic tests. Rapid immunoassay tests detect HIV antibodies in blood or oral fluid samples. They provide quick results, often within 20 minutes, making them widely used in point-of-care settings. Rapid molecular diagnostic tests, on the other hand, detect the presence of HIV genetic material (RNA or DNA) in samples. These tests are highly sensitive and specific, allowing for early detection and monitoring of HIV infection. Both types of machines play a crucial role in screening, diagnosing, and controlling the spread of HIV.</p></p>
