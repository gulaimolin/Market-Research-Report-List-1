<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tyre</li><li>Bias Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The car tyre market comprises two main types: radial tyres and bias tyres. Radial tyres are constructed with layers of cords aligned at a 90-degree angle to the direction of travel, providing better fuel efficiency, improved traction, and stability. In contrast, bias tyres have cords criss-crossed at an angle, resulting in increased load-bearing capacity and durability. Radial tyres dominate the market due to their superior performance, while bias tyres are commonly used in heavy-duty vehicles and off-road applications.</p></p>
