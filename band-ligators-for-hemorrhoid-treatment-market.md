<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Band Ligators for Hemorrhoid Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endoscopic Ligators</li><li>Non-endoscopic Ligators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Band ligators are devices used for the treatment of hemorrhoids. There are two main types of band ligators in the market: endoscopic ligators and non-endoscopic ligators. Endoscopic ligators are used during an endoscopy procedure, where a flexible tube with a camera is inserted into the rectum to locate and treat hemorrhoids. Non-endoscopic ligators, on the other hand, can be used without the need for an endoscopy and are applied directly to the hemorrhoid using various techniques. Both types of ligators aim to cut off the blood supply to the hemorrhoid, causing it to shrink and eventually fall off.</p></p>
